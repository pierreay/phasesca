# About

Main repository of the PhaseSCA project.

This project is about demonstrating the exploitation of phase-modulated emanations in electromagnetic side-channel analysis using software-defined radios (SDRs), instead of exploiting amplitude-modulated emanations as it is more conventionally done in the literature. 
This repository mainly contains documentation, sources and experiments of the project.
Small data files are stored directly in this repository, but datasets are stored on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (refer to [TCHES artifact](./docs/2025-01-23_tches-artifact/README.md)) and duplicated offline in another repository using [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/).

## Publication

This project led to the following [TCHES](https://tches.iacr.org/) publication: *Pierre Ayoub, Aurélien Hernandez, Romain Cayre, Aurélien Francillon, Clémentine Maurice (2025).

This project is also part of my PhD thesis: *Pierre Ayoub (2024). Compromising Electromagnetic Emanations: Side-Channel Leakages in Embedded Devices. Sorbonne Université. https://theses.fr/2024SORUS558 https://theses.hal.science/tel-05008752*

# Reproducing

As an introduction, one may want to check the [TCHES artifact evaluation](./docs/2025-01-23_tches-artifact/) to reproduce parts of our results.
All results and plots of the paper have been generated using one of the script and data in this repository, in such a way that everything must be easy to reproduce given the same hardware and software. 

## Requirements

### Software

The following software is included as `git` submodules inside this repository, and can be initialized by running:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

- **[phasesca-fw](https://github.com/pierreay/phasesca-fw.git)**

Source code used to flash the firmware we used on our target devices during our attacks.
Required to perform the data collection.

- **[SoapyRX](https://github.com/pierreay/soapyrx.git)** 

Utility used to record I/Q signals from the target device emanations using a software-defined radio (SDR).
Required to perform the data collection.

- **[SCAFF](https://github.com/pierreay/scaff.git)**

Used to to process and analyze the datasets composed of I/Q signals.
Required to perform the data analysis and the attacks.

### Hardware

- **SDR**: Pick one supported by SoapyRX.
- **Near-field probes**: Can be a COTS one or a handmade for frequencies between 8 and 128 MHz.
- **Device Under Test (DUT)**: Pick one described in the paper.
