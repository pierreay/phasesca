** [2024-01-30 mar.] Instantaneous phase visualization
:PROPERTIES:
:DIR:      2024-01-30_instant_phase_viz
:END:

- Based on ::
  - Recording from Screaming Channels labeled =240130_carrier_or_mod_soft_or_hard=.
- Goals ::
  - Compare the instantaneous phase of signals recorded during TX on (carrier only), AES software, AES hardware.
- Results ::
  - Significant deviations between signals.

** [2024-02-06 mar.] Instrument a firmware and compare leakage among frequencies in amplitude and phase
:PROPERTIES:
:DIR:      2024-02-06_firmware-instrumentation-for-phase-rot-leak
:END:

- Goals ::
  1. Compare the leakage in amplitude and phase rotation to see if we can see the signal.
- Methods ::
  1. Instrument the firmware with a recognizable pattern (TX Off, TX Carrier,
     AES Soft ECB, AES Hard ECB without counter, AES Hard ECB with interrupts,
     AES Hard CCM).
  2. Record at multiple frequencies and sampling rates. Analyze the received
     signal in bot amplitude and phase rotation.
- Results ::
  1. The leakage in the phase is already present in the baseband signal
     modulated around the clocks of the CPU. Hence, it may invalidate the
     theory that the SC phase leakage is produced by voltage variations of the
     VCO of the carrier.
- Files ::
  - FF is collected using an antenna in an anechoic box.
  - NF is collected using a NF probe out of the anechoic box.
  - [[attachment:firmware_loop.c]] is an extract of the firmware to see the
    pattern, see firmware repo and tag for code.

- Issue :: We have I and Q stored while we also have the amplitude and the
  phase rotation stored. While computing the amplitude and the phase rotation
  from the stored IQ, we don't get the same values as the stored amplitude and
  the phase rotation. See [[attachment:plot.py]].

- Goal :: Test the major vote mechanism to recombine information from more than
  2 channels.
- Vote method :: Vertical 4-way major vote at bit level for best subkey guess.
- Measure method :: Use the hamming distance between real key and best key.
- Results :: Seems to always perform better than amplitude, but not always
  better than the better (unpredictable) attack among the 4.

:END:

- Goal :: Test the "merging" of correlation coefficient given by 2 channels.
- Recombination Method :: Inspired from POI recombination, use addition or
  multiplication to combine result of correlation coefficient.
- Measure method :: Calculating key rank && Measuring hamming distance.
- Results :: Recombination is always better and finally lead to a key rank
  smaller of on order of magnitude of 10. This method is also better than major
  votes as it 1) easily allows to perform key enumeration and estimation 2)
  leads to smaller intermediate hamming distances.

- Goal :: As [[id:50f1a6fb-d65f-4b8c-af62-5895a4b93635][[2024-04-09 mar.] Recombination using correlation coefficient]]
  suggest, it is better to use addition instead of multiplication. Want to test
  weather using multiple POIs from same channel (amplitude) gives better
  results using addition instead of multiplication.
- Results :: POIs combination using addition is better than multiplication
  (look at logs files in [[attachment:logs/]]) but not better than no POI
  combination in our setup.

*First experiment*

We use an STM32 glitched on digital domain by a ChipWhisperer every 50 ms.

[[file:24-07-10_jitter-to-phr/expe1/PXL_20240710_174453755.jpg]]

On the oscilloscope, we can see the effect of the glitch translated to an amplitude noise and jitter.

On the radio, running:

#+begin_src bash :eval never
soapyrx --loglevel INFO --config ~/git/soapyrx/examples/example.toml record --duration=0.5 --no-agc --gain 33 64e6 10e6 --cut --plot --no-live --save-sig=/home/drac/pro_tmp/expe_sig.npy --save-plot=/home/drac/pro_tmp/expe_plot.png
#+end_src

We got, for both amplitude and phase rotation, the observation of the glitch every 50 ms.

*Second experiment*

By using the period value measured using the oscilloscope and the precise
jitter value (around 250 ps) for one precise glitch, we computed that it should
be translated to a 0.15 radian phase rotation. It corresponds to what we
measured.

#+CAPTION: A glitch which first (falling edge) decrease period will increase the phase rotation, and vice-versa.
